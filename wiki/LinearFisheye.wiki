#summary About as3fisheye

= Introduction =

The linear fisheye provides a fisheye projection based on Bederson's linear Degree of Interest function (Bederson, 2000). The Degree of Interest, DOI, is a function that describes the importance of an element compared to a "focussed" element. According to this function, the position of the elements around the focus element are determined.

This implementation allows a repartition of the entry values on the output range. An example can be found here: TO COMPLETE.

== public function LinearFisheye(min:Number, max:Number, outMin:Number, outMax:Number):void ==

 * _min, max:_ the range for the input values.
 * _outMin, outMax:_ the range for the output values. Typically, the position of a "fisheyed" element in a list.


== public function setFocus(focus:Number, focusDist:Number, distortPercent:Number, focusAreaPercent:Number):void ==

 * _focus:_ the focussed value.
 * _focusDist:_ the distortion of the focus area.
 * _distortPercent:_ the percentage of the total range that will be distorted.
 * _focusAreaPercent:_ the percentage of the total range that will be the focussed area.

== public function getValue(value:Number):Number ==

 * _value:_ the projected value.
