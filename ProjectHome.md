## Introduction ##

Fisheye in human-computer interaction is a graphical visualization technique to browse large datasets of information. It uses a spatial distortion of the fisheye lens to allow a user to see both the surrounding context and a focus area on the same view.

This actionscript library provides tools to represent such a view in the actionscript context. An example of application of the linear fisheye can be seen [here](http://2ndfondation.nuxit.net/projects/as3fisheye/FisheyeProject.html).

## Project status ##

  * 15th October 2008: Library released with linear fisheye.
  * 14th October 2008: First operational fisheye implementation using a linear Degree of Interest function (See recommanded reading or [example](http://2ndfondation.nuxit.net/projects/as3fisheye/FisheyeProject.html))
